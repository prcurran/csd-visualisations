# Data Visualisation Code for the CSD

"The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) contains a complete record of all published organic and metal-organic small-molecule crystal structures. The database has been in operation for over 50 years and continues to be the primary means of sharing structural chemistry data and knowledge across disciplines."
Groom, C. R., Bruno, I. J., Lightfoot, M. P. & Ward, S. C. (2016). Acta Cryst. B72, 171-179.

This repository contains code to visualising this data for various projects. 


## 1) Periodic Table Heatmap

This is an interactive heatmap visualisation of the periodic created with the Bokeh library. Elements are coloured by their frequency of occurrence in the CSD. For each entry in the CSD, the number of atoms in the molecular formula were counted.

A live version of this visualisation is presented [here!](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/educationalresources/PeriodicTable)


## 2) Chemical Space Visualisation


## 3) 3-Dimensionality
